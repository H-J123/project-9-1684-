This project, titled “AI-Driven Water Quality Analysis: A Machine Learning Approach for Potability Prediction,” is implemented with a Python backend (using Flask and ML libraries such as scikit-learn/XGBoost) and a web frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction and visualization. The machine learning side uses multiple classification models—including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes, and especially XGBoost, which achieves the best accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the water quality dataset. The main purpose of the project is to predict whether water is potable or not based on key physicochemical parameters (such as pH, turbidity, hardness, BOD, COD, TDS, nitrates, phosphates, and conductivity), and to provide a web-based platform where users can input these values and instantly get potability predictions along with graphs and visual summaries, helping support public health, environmental monitoring, and faster decision-making compared to conventional lab testing.
